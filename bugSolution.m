The solution involves ensuring proper handling of memory management.  If not using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), manually manage memory to avoid leaks.  In ARC, use strong/weak properties correctly to manage object lifecycles.

Here's the corrected code (using ARC):

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
// dealloc is not needed in ARC
@end

// ...in some method...
MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
obj.myString = [NSString stringWithString: "Hello"];
// No need to release obj explicitly in ARC. It will be deallocated automatically.
```

In non-ARC scenarios, ensure that `release` is paired with `retain` or `alloc` and that `dealloc` properly releases all owned objects.
