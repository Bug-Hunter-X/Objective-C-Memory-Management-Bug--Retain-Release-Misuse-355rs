This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Objective-C related to memory management. The `bug.m` file contains code that exhibits the error, while `bugSolution.m` shows the corrected version.  The bug stems from improper use of `retain` and `release` (or, in ARC, the absence of proper ownership handling) leading to memory leaks. This is a classic example of how incorrect reference counting can manifest as seemingly random crashes or performance degradation.
